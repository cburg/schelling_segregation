[ ] Implement a C++ backend
[ ] Implement processing in a separate thread
[ ] Make sure we can't press the reset button until a board has been

    board is reset in the middle of destroying the old board.
[ ] Implement a faster way of finding an open cell.
    For this, we'll probably just keep a lookup table of opencells
